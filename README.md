# Android Flask App

A simple flask web application to work with Android's WebView.

#### Individual applications

The following is the list of individual applications that make up this application(*Hopefully*).

- Store Inventory - A Flask application for basic store inventory.
- AFA API - An API used by the Flask application to get, add, update, and delete data from a database.
- Store Inventory WebView - An android application that uses WebView to render the Flask application on an android device(Hopefully).

Well happy hacking...
